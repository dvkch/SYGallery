SYGallery
=========

Pictures gallery to mimic iPhone app, using separated views to embed as you wish.

Multiple data source type is one of the goal, as FGallery does.


Nota Bene
=========

This project is not yet very well done. The fact I use it for my own apps forces me to investigate a lot of issues and fix them ASAP, but it also sometimes make me do a lot of changes in one commit (new submodule, etc) which CAN BREAK YOUR CODE ! So until I write otherwise here I really recommend iPhone app beginners to stay away from this one to keep their life simple ;-)
